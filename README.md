# cargo

An attempt to implement [the DDD Sample App](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core) in idiomatic Golang, 
so the project could be used to showcase the idiomatic project structuring, namings, etc.

At the same time, it's not the goal to blindly follow the DDD pracrices nor clean architecture. The goal is to identify the Go's way.
